            <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
            <p>posted by BGB, <time datetime="2016-11-15">November 15, 2016</time></p>
            <p>This week I am <em>extremely</strong> excited about a new cooking
                technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i>
                cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a
                water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the
                food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
                Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>
                <p>Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill
                Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before
